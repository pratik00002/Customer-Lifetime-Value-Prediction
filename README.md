Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction for an Auto Insurance Company
Introduction

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a critical metric that estimates the total value a customer brings to a company over the entire duration of their relationship. For auto insurance companies, understanding and predicting CLV is crucial, especially in a competitive market where insurance premiums alone do not determine customer retention. By leveraging CLV, companies can focus on retaining valuable customers, increasing revenue from less valuable customers, and enhancing the overall customer experience.
Business Problem

An auto insurance company in the USA is experiencing difficulties in retaining customers. To address this, they plan to use promotional offers targeted at loyal customers, guided by the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) metric. The goal is to accurately predict the CLV for each customer using machine learning regression models. This will enable the company to:

    Improve customer acquisition and retention.
    Prevent customer churn.
    Optimize marketing budget allocation.
    Measure the effectiveness of advertisements in detail.

By focusing on CLV, the company aims to enhance its customer-centric strategies, leading to better customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of customers based on a dataset containing various customer attributes and transaction details. The predicted CLV will help the company in making informed decisions regarding customer retention strategies, marketing campaigns, and promotional offers.
Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project includes 9134 records, each representing a customer's lifetime value along with over 24 features related to the customer's demographic information, policy details, vehicle information, and more. Some of the features in the dataset include:

    Customer ID
    Gender
    Age
    Income
    Education
    Marital Status
    Number of policies
    Policy Type
    Vehicle Class
    Vehicle Size
    Coverage
    Monthly Premium Auto
    Total Claim Amount
    CLV (target variable)

Detailed Project Plan
1. Data Understanding and Preparation

    Load the Dataset:
        Import the dataset and examine its structure.
        Check for null values and data types.

    Data Cleaning:
        Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
        Convert categorical features into suitable formats (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables).

    Feature Engineering:
        Create new features if relevant (e.g., interaction terms, derived metrics).
        Normalize or standardize features if necessary.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualize the distribution of the target variable (CLV).
        Analyze the relationship between features and the target variable using scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.
        Identify important features using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance from tree-based models.

2. Model Building

    Train-Test Split:
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

    Model Selection:
        Choose a variety of regression models to compare, such as:
            Linear Regression
            Decision Trees
            Random Forest
            Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
            Support Vector Regression (SVR)
            Neural Networks

    Model Training:
        Train each model on the training dataset.
        Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate models using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
        Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.

    Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen model.
        Employ cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.

3. Model Interpretation and Deployment

    Model Interpretation:
        Analyze feature importance to understand the factors influencing CLV the most.
        Use model-specific interpretation tools if needed (e.g., SHAP values for tree-based models).

    Model Deployment:
        Deploy the model in a real-time prediction environment if applicable.
        Ensure the model is integrated into the company's customer management and marketing systems.

    Model Monitoring:
        Continuously monitor the model's performance over time.
        Retrain the model periodically with new data to maintain its accuracy.
